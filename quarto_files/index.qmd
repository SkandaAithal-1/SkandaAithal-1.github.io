I am a Sophomore in the Department of Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. My current research interest is in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Control Theory and its application in autonomous intelligent systems. This interest started to stem in me because of my interest in robotics and me starting to study Machine Learning and Deep Learning.  

Now, the burning question you might have (because let's face it, my academic achievements are practically screaming for attention): what in the world does the **U** in my name stand for?  
Well the answer is **Uppunda**, my hometown.

Also do not try to look for me where I am supposed to be at.
